  <h1>Teaching Philosophy Coach</h1>
  <div class="meta">Jefferson Educator’s Portfolio • Workshop Series Resource (public, Copilot-readable)</div>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>For Copilot ingestion:</strong> This page summarizes core ideas, prompts, and rubrics for writing an educational philosophy statement. It is a text-first, static page so Copilot can index and answer questions from it.
  </div>

  <h2>Workshop Series (context)</h2>
  <p>The series frames the philosophy statement alongside three companion areas: Contributions to Teaching, Teaching Service &amp; Scholarship, and Peer Sharing. Sessions are led by Jefferson faculty across the sequence, culminating in the Educational Philosophy Statement focus.</p>

  <h2>Why “Tell Your Story” (and not slogans)?</h2>
  <p>A memorable teaching statement anchors on specific stories, strategies, and evidence—rather than generic claims. As James Lang notes, committees remember concrete narrative moments, not stock phrases about “student-centered classrooms.”</p>

  <h2>Your Resource Streams</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contributions to Teaching</strong> — roles, courses, innovations, assessments, mentoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning (SoTL)</strong> — design, study, dissemination of teaching/learning improvements; follow accepted academic standards for digital/educational scholarship.</li>
    <li><strong>Personifying the Jefferson Educator</strong> — reflect across the eight guiding domains below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Jefferson Educator – Guiding Domains</h2>
  <div>
    <span class="pill">Assessment for Learning</span>
    <span class="pill">Critical Self-Reflection</span>
    <span class="pill">Evidence-based Teaching</span>
    <span class="pill">Innovation</span>
    <span class="pill">Learner-Centeredness</span>
    <span class="pill">Learning Design</span>
    <span class="pill">Learning Environment Management</span>
    <span class="pill">Professional Vitality</span>
  </div>
  <p>Use these domains to generate examples, artifacts, and claims in your statement; connect each claim to evidence (student work, outcomes data, peer observation, or scholarship).</p>

  <h2>Prompts to Draft Your Statement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Student perspective:</strong> If your learners described your teaching, what consistent themes would they mention?</li>
    <li><strong>Signature activity:</strong> Describe one activity that best reflects the teacher you aim to be. Why does it work? What learning evidence do you see?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning goals &amp; evidence:</strong> What do you want students to learn? How do you know goals are met (artifacts, performance, feedback)?</li>
    <li><strong>Growth over time:</strong> How has your approach changed? What prompted the change (data, reflection, literature)?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Shape &amp; Flow (a workable outline)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Opening stance:</strong> A 2–3 sentence teaching ethos tied to a real context.</li>
    <li><strong>Approach in practice:</strong> Brief stories that illustrate tactics aligned to your goals and learner needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence of impact:</strong> Link claims to artifacts, results, or scholarship.</li>
    <li><strong>Ongoing growth:</strong> How you iterate—reflection, peer review, assessment cycles.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Peer Review &amp; Rubric Cues</h2>
  <p>Use a concise rubric to review each other’s drafts: clarity of stance, alignment to evidence, coherence, and growth reflection. Incorporate fix-forward suggestions (specific next edit or artifact to add) rather than only critique.</p>

  <h2>Try It with Copilot</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“Draft a 150-word opening that shows my stance on <em>Assessment for Learning</em> with one story.”</li>
    <li>“Rewrite this paragraph to foreground learner evidence, not my intentions.”</li>
    <li>“List three artifacts that could support my claim about inclusive small-group facilitation.”</li>
  </ul>
